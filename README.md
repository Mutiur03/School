# 🏫 School Management System — Full-Stack Web Application

The **School Management System** is a comprehensive web application developed to streamline and digitize the administrative, academic, and communication processes of educational institutions. Built as a solo full-stack project, this platform centralizes student records, exam results, attendance tracking, event management, and more — all in a secure, modern interface.

---

## 🗂️ Monorepo Structure

This repository contains multiple apps and services:

- `admin/` — Admin dashboard (React + Vite)
- `students/` — Student dashboard (React + Vite)
- `teachers/` — Teacher dashboard (Next.js)
- `server/` — Backend API (Node.js + Express + Prisma)
- `public/` — Shared frontend assets and styles

Each app is independently deployable and communicates with the backend via REST APIs.
